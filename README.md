Childhood Memory VR Scene – "The Painter's Room"

About the Scene
This VR experience is a personal recreation of a cherished childhood memory — my love for painting. The scene is set in a cozy room designed to reflect the environment where I used to spend hours drawing and painting as a kid.

The room includes interactive objects like a painting board, chair, and table. When you click the painting board, you're transported to another immersive scene — representing a dream-like space inspired by childhood imagination and creativity.

This scene was built to evoke nostalgia and let users explore a space that represents childhood joy, freedom, and artistic expression.
